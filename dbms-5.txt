g. SQL LIKE Operator 
		The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
		There are two wildcards used in conjunction with the LIKE operator:
* % - The percent sign represents zero, one, or multiple characters
* _ - The underscore represents a single character
Example-1 Customer Name starting with "a":
	SELECT * FROM Persons
	WHERE FirstName LIKE 'a%';
Example-2 Customer Name ending with "a":
	SELECT * FROM Persons
	WHERE FirstName LIKE '%a';
		Example-3 Customer Name that have "or" in any position:
			SELECT * FROM Customers
			WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%';
		Example-4 Customer Name that have "r" in second position:	
			SELECT * FROM Customers
			WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%';
	Example-4 Customer Name that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length:	
		SELECT * FROM Customers
		WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%_%';
	Exmaple-5  Selects all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p":
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE City NOT LIKE '[bsp]%';
